Hi There!

I want to make a personal finance/budget application. Often times, I'm curious to know at a moment's notice where am I at financially, what's the year's outlook, can I save for this or that? I believe knowing your numbers gives you options and having some type of reporting capability that can be run ad-hoc with graphics will really make you feel every dollar that you have made, saved, and spent. The business requirements for this application are: 

1) The application must be built with modern tools and have a responsive layout for all types of platforms(Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)
2) The application must contain a login page, user registration service, and a Forgot My Password service
3) The application must have the ability to display and download finance/budget reports
4) The application must be a Single-Page Application (SPA)
5) The application must contain search filters to sort by month, day, year, item, cost in the form of ($, $$, $$$, $$$$)
6) The application must contain a landing page dashboard with a pie-chart displaying each item category in a different color and percentage
7) The application must contain a function for adding, removing, and modifying expenses
